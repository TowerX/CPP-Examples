2 - The program should input from the user 10 people’s names and their telephone numbers and add the data to the parallel arrays.
3 - When data input is finished, the program should sort both data arrays in ascending order based on telephone numbers maintaining the associations between namesand telephone numbers.
4 - The program will print the list of usersand their telephone numbers after sorting.
5 - After printing the list, the program will ask for a name to search for.
